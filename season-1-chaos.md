# Respawn: Season 1 - Big Guns

This expansion for Respawn provides some optional rules you can add to your games.

## The Big Guns!

Big Guns are a new type of pick up that can be placed on your battlefield using a suitable marker. Unlike the original pick ups you do not roll to determine the result until a character picks it up. In addition, once a character picks up a Big Gun they immediately perform a free action with the weapon then end their activation.

When picking up a Big Gun roll a d6 and consult the list below to see which weapon they will use:
