## Tournament Games

Respawn can be played in one-off matches, or you can play over multiple games, with multiple players, representing a tournament of games. This adds additional perks for your teams that they can earn through their success and a bigger challenge in competing not just for a single victory, but to become the Tournament Champions.

A typical tournament involves each player playing 5 games and a final. For the initial 5 games, where relevant, you should randomise which player is playing against opponent. Players will score 2 points for winning their game, 1 point for a draw, and no points for a defeat. The last game is a special format elimination deathmatch featuring multiple players. If you have up to 4 players in your tournament, all players will take part in this game. If you have more than 4 players you should arrange the players into tiered matches as best fits, aiming to have 3-4 players in each game. The elimination deathmatch determines the final positions of each player.

### Elimination Deathmatch

The Elimination Deathmatch is a special mission designed for 2-4 players. Unlike most games of Respawn, players have a limited number of Respawns available to them equal to the number of points they have scored during the first 5 games of the tournament. The Elimination Deathmatch has no round limit.

#### Battlefield

The battlefield should be set up with 6 entry points spaced randomly around the outside of the battlefield numbered from 1 - 6. Each time a character is brought onto the battlefield from reserve the player must roll 2d6 and choose their entry point number from one of those dice results.

#### Objectives

There are no Victory Points to score in the Elimination Deathmatch, the goal is to be the last team on the battlefield. As each team runs out of respawns they will no longer be able to bring back their characters. When a player loses their last character and has no remaining respawns they are eliminated. The players final positions in the tournament are determined by the order they are eliminated, with the last player winning that match.
