# Respawn: Season 2 - Run and Gun

---

This expansion for Respawn provides some optional rules you can add to your games.

## Run and Gun

This expansion provides lots of new ways for your models to move around the battlefield with the following:

### Playing With Portals

Every model in your army is equipped with a Portal Gun

### Dropping In

Every model in your team deploys from reserve by "dropping in", possibly from some kind of flying public transport. Instead of using the normal entry points a player decides where the model is attempting to drop in and marks that spot. They then roll 2D6, the other player picks a point up that many inches from the chosen spot and the player places their model and activates as normal from there. If the other player is able to move the spot off the battlefield the model fails to deploy, it counts as an activation, the model loses 1 Command Point, and is placed in reserve again.

### Rocket Packs

Every model in your team has access to a Rocket Pack which gives them the following ability:

| Name         | Cost | Effect |
| :----------- | :--: | :----- |
| Rocket Jump | 2CP  | This model makes a special move where it must move at least 2 times it's Movement attribute, and up to 3 times it's Movement attribute and counts as flying. This ability may not be used if the model performs a Move action this activation. Before making the move, the player rolls a D6, on a roll of 1 the opponent decides which direction the model must move. |

## Special Terrain: Energy Barriers

Terrain with the Energy Barrier keyword counts as clear terrain for the puroses of movement, however, any line of sight drawn through this terrain counts as blocked.

## New Objectives: Proximity Objectives

Proximity objectives are a type of objective that does not need to be secured to be scored. Instead, a proximity objectives are either active or inactive, at the end of any round in which a proximity objective is active, all models within 6 inches of the objective marker score the objective. The mission rules will dictate when a proximity objective is active.

## New Mission: Hot Zone

#### Battlefield

The battlefield should be set up with 4 entry points, one in in each corner of the battlefield numbered from 1 - 4. Each time a character is brought onto the battlefield from reserve the player must roll a d6 to determine which entry point they must use, on a roll of a 5 or 6 the player may choose which entry point they use.

Place 4 proximity objectives, each halfway between one of the 4 corners and the centre of the battlefield, number these from 1 - 4. Roll a d6 at the start of a new round:

- On a roll of 1 or 3 then objectives 1 and 3 are active this round.
- On a roll of 2 or 4 then objectives 2 and 4 are active this round.
- On a roll of 5 or 6 then all objectives are active this round.

#### Objectives

- Each team scores 1 Victory Points for each character that scores an active proximity objective.
- Each team scores 1 Victory Point if they score an objective that no enemy character scores.
- Each team scores 1 Victory Point each time they kill an enemy character.
- Each team scores 2 Victory Points if they kill all enemy characters in a round.

The first team to reach 15 Victory Points wins the match, or the player with the most Victory Points when the game ends.
