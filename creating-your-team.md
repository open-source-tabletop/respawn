# Creating Your Team

---

Games of Respawn consist of 2 or more teams of 3 characters, if you want to play larger games you can assemble your teams in groups of 3 following the rules below. Teams in Respawn often create their own unique look, able to customise their appearance, weapons, and equipment as they please, any miniatures can be used so long as both players are using miniatures approximately the same size.
